# simpleCalcAPI

Hi there!
This is simple calculation API that get math expression as a JSON {request:math expression} and return a JSON {response:number}
Working with positive and negative digits, operators:+,-,*,/ , that can be extended by adding it to service classes.
If an expression can not be calculate API return 418 code.
